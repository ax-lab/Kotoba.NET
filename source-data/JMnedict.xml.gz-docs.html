<h4> Introduction</h4>
<p>
The ENAMDICT/JMnedict files contain Japanese proper names; place-names, 
surnames, given names, company names, names of artistic and literary works, product names,
etc..
These were originally included in the EDICT file, 
along with other non-name entries. By late 1995, the number of name entries
had exceeded the others, and the file was becoming unmanageably large,
so the decision was made to split it.  From this split came the ENAMDICT file.
</p>
<p>
The JMnedict (Japanese Multilingual Named Entity Dictionary) was initially simply
the ENAMDICT file reformatted into an XML file in UTF-8 coding. It also
had a small number of names which use kanji from the JIS X 0212 character set.
</p>
<p>
In 2016 the JMnedict file was included the the online database  system used for
maintaining and distributing the JMdict/EDICT dictionaries, and XSLT utilities
developed for extracting the original ENAMDICT format file from it.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h4> Format</h4>
<p>
The format of the ENAMDICT file is similar to the EDICT file,
and the 
 <a href="http://www.edrdg.org/jmdict/edict_doc.html">EDICT documentation </a>
should be consulted for more information.
</p>
<p>
The names have classification codes associated with them. The codes are
</p>
<pre>s - surname (138,500)
p - place-name (99,500)
u - person name, either given or surname, as-yet unclassified (139,000) 
g - given name, as-yet not classified by sex (64,600)
f - female given name (106,300)
m - male given name (14,500)
h - full (usually family plus given) name of a particular person (30,500)
pr - product name (55)
c - company name (34)
o - organization name
st - stations (8,254)
wk - work of literature, art, film, etc.
</pre>
<p>
These codes are at the front of each group of translations, e.g.
"(f) Hiroko" or "(s) Tanaka".
</p>
<p>
In addition, a number of country-names are added in parentheses after
place-names.
</p>
<p>
The JMnedict is structured according to its DTD, which is at the front 
of the file.
</p>
<p>
</p>
